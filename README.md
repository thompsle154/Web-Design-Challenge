# Web-Design-Challenge

A website was created using HTML, bootstrap, and CSS and information from the python-api-challenge. The wesite was created to show a summary dashboard, a drop down list, and menu choices to navigate between pages. Analysis is available on each visualization plot: Wind speed, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Max Temperature. The comparison page shows all plot together for easy analysis. The data was provided from the cities.csv file available in the Resources folder with 527 rows of city data.
