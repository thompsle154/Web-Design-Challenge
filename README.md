# Web-Design-Challenge

A website was created using HTML, bootstrap, and CSS and information from the python-api-challenge. The wesite was created to show a summary dashboard, a drop down list, and menu choices to navigate between pages. Analysis is available on each visualization plot: Wind speed, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Max Temperature. The data was provided from the cities.csv file available in the Resources folder with 527 rows of city data.
